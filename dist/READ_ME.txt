This is a final project for my CSC1351 class (from freshman year).

Controls:
WASD: move the character around
Arrow Keys: punch in the direction that you press
Q: use arnament haki ability (gives extra damage and a damage radius to each punch)
E: use observation haki ability (slows down everything but you)
2: use gear 2 ability (speeds you up, makes your punches faster and do more damage)
3: use gear 3 ability (makes your fists bigger and does more damage)


Basics:
Survive, get the highest score you can.

Killing enemies raises your score and your progress to the next difficulty.
* There are three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard (each displayed by a pirate flag from the story of One Piece)
* In easy difficulty, both private (melee only) and marksman (shoots bullets) are present. In medium and hard, the grenadier (throws grenades) can also spawn.
* In each difficulty, the amount of max enemies that are attacking you at once raises.
* When you get to the next difficulty, you fully heal

When the ability bars turn golden, you can use them.
* Fill up ability bars by defeating enemies. The numbers on each are: (current XP/max XP)
	* Arnament haki and Observation haki don't need max XP to be usable!
* Arnament haki: turns golden after 50 XP; Observation haki: turns golden after 100 xp; Gear 2 & 3: turns golden when bar is fully filled
