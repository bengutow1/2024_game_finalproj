This is a game I made for a final project during my Freshman year of college. It utilizes BasicGraphics, 
  a package made by my professor to give us a barebones game engine to work with, and it's not included
  in the files.

All of the controls are located in the README.txt located in the dist/ folder.

How to run:
Clone the repository using **git clone https://github.com/bengutow1/game_final_project.git**
Step into the folder using **cd game-final-project**, and then into the dist/ folder using **cd dist**
Next, run the jar file using **java -jar 2024-spring-final-project.jar**
